# Advance Component Types 

## Building flexible component with union literal type

we want two version of an InfoBox, one which just returns children, another one that returns warning. we want to return different content based on some prop that tells me wether InfoBox should run info mode or the warning mode.
In first approach: we define two separate conditions in parent element one if we want "hint" mode, and another if we want "warning" mode.
in InfoBox component we have a prop type to choose between either hint or warning mode.

```typescript

//Parent
export default function CourseGoalList({
  goals,
  onDeleteGoal,
}: CourseGoalListProps) {
  if (goals.length === 0) {
    return (
      <InfoBox mode="hint">
        You have no course goals yet. Start adding some!
      </InfoBox>
    );
  }

  let warningBox: ReactNode;

  if (goals.length >= 4) {
    warningBox = (
      <InfoBox mode="warning">
        You're collecting a lot of goals. Don't put too much on your plate!
      </InfoBox>
    );
  }

  return (
    <>
      {warningBox}
      <ul>
        {goals.map((goal) => (
          <li key={goal.id}>
            <CourseGoal id={goal.id} title={goal.title} onDelete={onDeleteGoal}>
              <p>{goal.description}</p>
            </CourseGoal>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

// Child

import { type ReactNode } from 'react';

type InfoBoxProps = {
  mode: 'hint' | 'warning';
  children: ReactNode;
};

export default function InfoBox({ mode, children }: InfoBoxProps) {
  if (mode === 'hint') {
    return (
      <aside className="infobox infobox-hint">
        <p>{children}</p>
      </aside>
    );
  }

  return (
    <aside className="infobox infobox-warning warning--medium">
      <h2>Warning</h2>
      <p>{children}</p>
    </aside>
  );
}
```

## Discriminated union

This is where we make diferent objects with an identification property (here: mode) and then requiring diferent other properties depending on that mode property.
The problem:
What if we want to set a different severity of tailwind classes for warning mode and we set it from parent element?
we can add a _severity_ prop and its union literal types: _'low' | 'medium' | 'high'_ , but we got an error for "hint" mode, because we don't need it in that mode and we don't set it, one solution is to make severity prop optional __Either by adding "|undefined" to the end of that or "?" mark before semicolon__ but if we forget to set a severity prop in warning mode, we don't get any type error of it!

We want to use InfoBox _in hint mode without severity prop and and in warning mode with it_ we don't want to allow using this component in warning mode without severity, because our css class doesn't work correctly.

The solution:
Using discriminated union, it means defining two prop type for a component and combine them by union type (i.e | ) :
 _type InfoBoxProps = HintBoxProps | WarningBoxProps_

after that we can not destructure props and we should use it as a "prop" and separately destructure them inside component and typescript can infer each one:
_const { children, mode } = props;_
// TS understands that we pass hint mode and this is a warning mode
_const { severity } = props;_

```typescript
import { type ReactNode } from 'react';

type HintBoxProps = {
  mode: 'hint';
  children: ReactNode;
};

type WarningBoxProps = {
  mode: 'warning';
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  children: ReactNode;
};

// union type for two discriminated prop types
type InfoBoxProps = HintBoxProps | WarningBoxProps;


// we cant destructure props here 
export default function InfoBox(props: InfoBoxProps) {


  const { children, mode } = props;

  if (mode === 'hint') {
    return (
      <aside className="infobox infobox-hint">
        <p>{children}</p>
      </aside>
    );
  }
// TS understands that we pass hint mode and this is a warning mode 
  const { severity } = props;

  return (
    <aside className={`infobox infobox-warning warning--${severity}`}>
      <h2>Warning</h2>
      <p>{children}</p>
    </aside>
  );
}

```

## Building a wrapper component OR ComponentPropsWithoutRef<...> Prop

### ComponentPropsWithoutRef

It's an special prop for all the build-in props that default element accepts, we define that specific element as a related prop of this generic type. for example here: _ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'input'>_
after that we pass all the build-in props as a _...props_ to the special element.
```typescript
import { ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from 'react';

type InputProps = {
  label: string;
  id: string;
  // merging our own costume props with all built-in props of an input element
} & ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'input'>;

// accepting all the build in props as ...props
export default function Input({label, id, ...props}: InputProps) {
  return (
    <p>
      <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label>

      // passing all the build in props which are added by ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'input'> to the input element
      <input id={id} {...props} />
    </p>
  );
}
```

## Building a wrapper component that renders different elements

We can use alder method to create an element which behaves like a button and/or anchor whenever we want each one.
we can't destructure 'el' and other props but by conditional check TS will found the each ones built-in props.

```typescript

// parent 
function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <p>
        <Button el="button">A Button</Button>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Button el="anchor" href='https://google.com'>A Link</Button>
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}

// child
import { type ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from 'react';

type ButtonProps = {
  el: 'button';
} & ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'>;

type AnchorProps = {
  el: 'anchor';
} & ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'a'>;

export default function Button(props: ButtonProps | AnchorProps) {
  // const {el, ...otherProps} = props;
  if (props.el === 'anchor') {
    return <a className="button" {...props}></a>;
  }

  return <button className="button" {...props}></button>;
}
```

## Button with type predicate

In the case above, we always have to set an el prop.

### Js _in_ property

clause _if ("href" in props)_ checks if href is in props or not and returns boolean; but TS can not find that!
so we add a new TS type nad we should define a function to _predicate the type_ but it does not work until we tell it!

### _props is AnchorProps_ or type predicate

```typescript
function isAnchorProps(props: ButtonProps | AnchorProps): props is AnchorProps {
  return 'href' in props;
}
```

we return more specific type for this function that caries more specific data for typescript; It says if this function returns "true", its type is _AnchorProps_

### never type

still user can set a 'href' prop for a button and disable prop for an anchor, se we should get TS more information about each element; we set _type ButtonProps = ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'> & {href?: never}_ to tell TS _it could never get a href prop_
after all TS understands that one of them should have button behavior and another anchor behavior.

```typescript
// parent 
function App() {
  return (
    <main>
      <p>
        <Button>A Button</Button>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Button href='https://google.com'>A Link</Button>
      </p>
    </main>
  );
}

// child

import { type ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from 'react';

type ButtonProps = ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'button'> & {
  href?: never;
};

type AnchorProps = ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'a'> & {
  href?: string;
};

function isAnchorProps(props: ButtonProps | AnchorProps): props is AnchorProps {
  return 'href' in props;
}

export default function Button(props: ButtonProps | AnchorProps) {
  if (isAnchorProps(props)) {
    return <a className="button" {...props}></a>;
  }

  return <button className="button" {...props}></button>;
}

```

## Polymorphic wrapper component 

### Basic Wrapper by the identifier _Element Type_

we want to the recieve the component that should be returned as props
_as_ prop is an identifier _the name is up to us_ to recieve the identifier of the component that should be return by this container component. __ElementType__ is an special type that says the value should be some valid identifier of a component, _anything that can be output as jsx_ (not the jsx, thats ReactNode Type, but the identifier of jsx).

```typescript
import { type ElementType } from 'react';

type ContainerProps = {
  as: ElementType
};

export default function Container({as}: ContainerProps) {

  // It could be As, anything that starts with Capital case
  const Component = as;
  return <Component />
}
```

### Final Wrapper with polymorphic component

we want to add built-in props by _ComponentPropsWithoutRef_ but the problem is that we don't know which kind of prop we should pass to angle brackets of that, so we should create our own generic type. _we can turn the "ContainerProps" type into a generic type that works only in conjunction with another type_ thats the core idea of the generic types, they allow us to connect multiple types to work together: _type ContainerProps<T extends ElementType> = {}_ to accept some type that should then be set from the place where ContainerProps are being used. we setting the placeholder for that incoming extra type information. This <T> should be the identifier of the type that set as a value for _as_ , so we can use that T that we recieve as a value for _ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T>_. The problem is that T could be anything, it could be number and string too, TS allows us to extends a condition to expected generic type _T extends ElementType_. Now ContainerProps should be used with some type that will be defined at the point of time where T type should be based on ElementType, It must be some element.
Now we should define that concrete type where we're using container props and we don't know which element we use in _Container_, so we turn it to generic function too, _Container<C extends ElementType>_ it again does not use to set some generic type values but instead to accept one to turn it from non-generic function to generic function. we can use T but here to emphasize its not related to above T we name it C. know we can pass this C to ContainerProps. without _extends ElementType_ we get error because it must be based ion element type which we define above.
TS can not fully understand this complex code, we make "as" optional and add a default element (like a 'div') for Component _const Component = as || 'div';_ with that TS understands that Component can always be a wrapper.

```typescript

import {
  type ReactNode,
  type ElementType,
  type ComponentPropsWithoutRef,
} from 'react';

type ContainerProps<T extends ElementType> = {
  as?: T;
  children: ReactNode;
} & ComponentPropsWithoutRef<T>;

export default function Container<C extends ElementType>({
  as,
  children,
  ...props
}: ContainerProps<C>) {
  const Component = as || 'div';
  return (
    <Component {...props}>
      {children}
    </Component>
  );
}
```

## Using ForwardRef with TS

We want to add "ref" prop to input, and set it from outside of the input component. _It doesn't work with turning ComponentPropsWithoutRef to ComponentPropsWithRef_ , it works but does not do what we want. we should:

- wrap input component function with the _forwardRef_ and passing our component function as a value for that.
- we should store it in a function and then export it.
- The component no longer receives just a prop _instead it also receive a "ref" parameter_ : _(function Input({ label, id, ...props }, ref)_
- It throws an error that this new define "ref" refers to an unknown value _ref: React.ForwardRef<unknown>_ because forwardRef in the end is a wrapper around some value that we're managing, TS does not know which value will receive on that object _therefor it does'nt know if this "ref" refers to a value that can be received as the input element_ thats why forwardRef is a generic function where we should provide extra information of the related type; _forwardRef<HTMLInputElement, InputProps>_ and here __The relates type is the type of value that will eventually be stored in that ref__ which in this case is a _HTMLInputElement_ 
- thats not enough, forwardRef is a generic function and wants two generic types, if we specify one type, we also have to specify the second type. and _the second types refer to the type of props that the component function will received_ here:InputProps.
- therefor in the parent component we also should provide this extra generic type here _const input = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);_ to make it clear that the "ref" we're managing here will eventually be connected an html input element and will store such an element object in the future.

```typescript

// parent
function App() {
  const input = useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null);

  return (
    <main>
      <Input label="Test" id="test" ref={input} />
    </main>
  );
}

// child
import { forwardRef, type ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from 'react';

type InputProps = {
  label: string;
  id: string;
} & ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'input'>;

const Input = forwardRef<HTMLInputElement, InputProps>(function Input(
  { label, id, ...props },
  ref
) {
  return (
    <p>
      <label htmlFor={id}>{label}</label>
      <input id={id} {...props} ref={ref} />
    </p>
  );
});

export default Input;
```

## Wrapper form component 

### handling the form submission by form wrapper

_formSubmission_ function will receive an event which its type is _FormEvent_ which is a generic type that we can specify which element trigger that event, here is HTMLFormElement because we want to submit this function to unSubmit function: _event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>_.
now we should extract form data; by using javascript built-in method _new FormData(event.currentTarget);_ we can gather all the data from all the inputs and group them into an object, which of course all the inputs must receive a name. but for example we can not access the data into "name" field by 'data.name' instead we should use a get method: _data.get('name')_ we simplify that by using _Object.Entries()_ and now we access the data just like a regular object:

```typescript
  function handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();

    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
    const data = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    // onSave(data);
  }
```

### passing data from the form component to the parent component that using the form

we can achieve this by merging our _ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'form'>_ with costume props object: _ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'form'> & {onSave: (value: unknown) => void }_ to add more props to our costume component, the _value_ type can be anything because our form can wrap anything and we should set is as _unknown_ type. now we can pass _props.onSave_ to the submission function and we can define _function handleSave(data: unknown)_ function in wrapper or parent element. inside of the parent handleSave we now have to deal with the fact that we dont know what the data will be, but we know the shape of data in our inputs: _const extractedData = data as { name: string; age: string };_ __as__ keyword convinced typescript that we know the shape of data. we create an object in _Object.Entries_ and in it, we know better than typescript that is _name:string_ and _age:string_.
At the end we should destructure the onSave from children and other props, because we pass all props and merge them with onSave at formProps therefore its not an standard props object and TS yield at us for that, we destructure it and just pass _otherprops_ to form element that are known for TS.

```typescript
  function handleSave(data: unknown) {
    const extractedData = data as { name: string; age: string };
    console.log(extractedData);
  }
```

```typescript

//parent

function App() {
  function handleSave(data: unknown) {
    const extractedData = data as { name: string; age: string };
    console.log(extractedData);
  }

  return (
    <main>
      <Form onSave={handleSave}>
        <Input type="text" label="Name" id="name" />
        <Input type="number" label="Age" id="age" />
        <p>
          <Button>Save</Button>
        </p>
      </Form>
    </main>
  );
}


//child
import { type FormEvent, type ComponentPropsWithoutRef } from 'react';

type FormProps = ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'form'> & {
  onSave: (value: unknown) => void;
};

export default function Form({ onSave, children, ...otherProps }: FormProps) {
  function handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();
 
    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
    const data = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    onSave(data);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} {...otherProps}>
      {children}
    </form>
  );
}

```

## Exposing Component APIs with useImperativeHandle

we want to expose the function from the outside of the form to interact with it.
for example we want to use built in _reset()_ method of form and it uses useRef function.
we want to for example by using _form.current.clear()_ from the outside of the Form component reset it.

### useImperativeHandle

we need to expose an API in Form component and in react _useImperativeHandle_ does that. this also _only receives in a component with forwarder ref_. in the first argument useImperativeHandle recieve "ref" and as a second argument it accepts a function which returns an object, and _this object can then contain any methods you want to be able to call on this component from outside_ 
now in the upper component that we call Form, here App.tsx, we should create a ref which connects with Form component. _const customForm = useRef<FormHandle>(null);_ and _<Form onSave={handleSave} ref={customForm}>_, now we get error when we call it: _customForm.current?.clear();_ because its not clear to typescript that this customForm ref will be connected to an object that has a clear method, so we should define and export a new type to access it in upper component, this type should describe the function that returns by imperative handle function: _export type FormHandle = {clear: () => void;}_ because thats what this forwarded ref will be referring to, i.e. _customForm will refer to returned object from the useImperativeHandle not the whole Form component_ and we will accept this as type for costumeForm ref: _const customForm = useRef<FormHandle>(null);_

```typescript
export type FormHandle = {
  clear: () => void;
};

type FormProps = ComponentPropsWithoutRef<'form'> & {
  onSave: (value: unknown) => void;
};

const Form = forwardRef<FormHandle, FormProps>(function Form(
  { onSave, children, ...otherProps },
  ref
) {
  const form = useRef<HTMLFormElement>(null);

  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => {
    return {
      clear() {
        console.log('CLEARING');
        form.current?.reset();
      },
    };
  });

  function handleSubmit(event: FormEvent<HTMLFormElement>) {
    event.preventDefault();

    const formData = new FormData(event.currentTarget);
    const data = Object.fromEntries(formData);
    onSave(data);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit} {...otherProps} ref={form}>
      {children}
    </form>
  );
});

export default Form;


// Parent

function App() {
  const customForm = useRef<FormHandle>(null);

  function handleSave(data: unknown) {
    const extractedData = data as { name: string; age: string };
    console.log(extractedData);
    customForm.current?.clear();
  }

  return (
    <main>
      <Form onSave={handleSave} ref={customForm}>
        <Input type="text" label="Name" id="name" />
        <Input type="number" label="Age" id="age" />
        <p>
          <Button>Save</Button>
        </p>
      </Form>
    </main>
  );
}

```
